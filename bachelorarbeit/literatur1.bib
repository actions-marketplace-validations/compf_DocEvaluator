The distinctive features of EGL are described, in particular its novel design which inherits a number of language concepts and logical features from a base model navigation and modification language. The value of being able to use a M2T language as part of an extensible model management tool chain is outlined in a case study, and EGL is compared to other M2T languages.},

  abstract  = {Model-Driven Development requires model management languages and tools for supporting model operations such as editing, consistency checking, and transformation. At the core of these model management techniques is a set of facilities for model navigation and modification. A subset of the Object Constraint Language can be used for some of these tasks, but it has limitations as a general-purpose language to be used in a variety of model management tasks. We present the metamodel independent Epsilon Object Language (EOL) which builds on OCL. EOL can be used both as a standalone generic model management language or as infrastructure on which task-specific languages can be built. We describe how it has been used to construct a selection of languages, such as model merging, comparison, and text generation languages.},

  abstract  = {Support for automated model transformation is essential for realizing a Model Driven Development (MDD) process. However, model transformation is only one of the many tools in a model engineering toolkit. To apply MDD in the large, automated support for a number of additional tasks such as model comparison, merging, validation and model-to-text transformation, is essential. While a number of successful model transformation languages have been currently proposed, the majority of them have been developed in isolation and as a result, they face consistency and integration difficulties with languages that support other model management tasks. We present the Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL), a hybrid model transformation language that has been developed atop the infrastructure provided by the Epsilon model management platform. By building atop Epsilon, ETL is seamlessly integrated with a number of other task-specific languages to help to realize composite model management workflows.},
